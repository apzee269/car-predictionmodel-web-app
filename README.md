<h1><b>Car Prediction Model Web Application </b></h1>

This repository contains the code for a web application that predicts the price of a used car based on its features. The prediction model is built using machine learning algorithms and the web application is built using Flask, a Python web framework.

<b>Getting Started</b><br>
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

<b> Prerequisites </b> <br>
Before you can run the code, you'll need to have the following software installed on your computer:

Python 3.x <br>
Flask <br>
scikit-learn <br>
pandas <br>
numpy <br>

You can install these packages using the following command:

pip install Flask scikit-learn pandas numpy

<b> Installing </b>

1) Clone the repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/apzee269/car-predictionmodel-web-app.git

2) Navigate into the project directory:

cd car-predictionmodel-web-app

3) Start the Flask web server:

export FLASK_APP=app.py
flask run

The web application should now be running on your local machine at http://localhost:5000/.

<b> Deployment </b>

The steps for deploying the web application to a production environment will depend on the specific hosting platform you choose. However, most hosting platforms offer easy-to-follow instructions for deploying Flask applications.

<b>Built With</b> <br>
Flask - The web framework used <br>
scikit-learn - Machine learning library for Python <br>
pandas - Data analysis library for Python <br>
numpy - Numerical computing library for Python <br>
